## justNotes --> A Minimal Note-Taking App

Just notes is a Single Page Web Application Made in India using the following tech stack.
--> Frontend: ReactJS<br/>
--> Backend: NodeJS<br/>
--> DB: MongoDB Atlas<br/>

## The App has the following features:
--> A New User can Sign up/ Register to use the App. <br/>
--> A User Can log in to the app to Add/ Edit their notes.<br/>
--> A User can search through the notes using the search bar.<br/>
--> A User is Authenticated using JWT Tokens.<br/>
--> Password is hashed for the users on Signup, ensuring Password security that not even the developers/People with DB access can see.<br/>

I am constantly working on the app in order to improve the experience.
